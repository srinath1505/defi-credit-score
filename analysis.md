## Observations

### High Scorers (700-1000) - (1999 wallets)
- These wallets demonstrate responsible DeFi behavior
- Typically have multiple repayments relative to borrows
- No history of liquidations
- Diverse asset usage (multiple tokens)
- Consistent but not robotic transaction patterns
- Healthy collateral-to-debt ratios

### Mid Scorers (300-700) - (1491 wallets)
- Moderate DeFi activity with some risk factors
- May have occasional liquidations or inconsistent repayment patterns
- Generally maintain reasonable collateral ratios
- Activity spans a meaningful timeframe

### Low Scorers (0-300) - (7 wallets)
- High risk behavior patterns
- Frequent liquidations
- Little to no repayment activity
- Often exhibit bot-like transaction patterns (very regular timing)
- May have extreme collateral ratios (either too high or too low)
- Limited asset diversity or single-asset concentration

## Conclusion

The credit scoring model effectively differentiates between responsible and risky wallet behavior in the Aave V2 protocol. 

Key findings:
- Most wallets fall in the mid-score range (300-700), indicating moderate DeFi activity with some risk factors
- High scorers are relatively rare but demonstrate exemplary DeFi behavior
- Low scorers often exhibit patterns associated with bots, liquidation risks, or poor financial management

This scoring system provides a valuable tool for assessing wallet reliability in DeFi protocols, with potential applications in risk management, lending decisions, and protocol governance.
